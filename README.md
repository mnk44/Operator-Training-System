The SECPROIT system is intended for factories in the Food Industry. It is responsible for training operators through virtual training. Each training is intended for a process, where each process has variables, causes and recommendations. The variables are those elements that can present a danger, the causes are the reasons why the component is outside its usual range (why it is dangerous) and the recommendations are the actions to be taken to avoid an accident.
This system seeks to improve the selection and training of workers in a factory. It uses an expert system and a fuzzy logic flow for training evaluation.
